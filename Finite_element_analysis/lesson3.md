# Lesson 3: Abaqus Interface

This chapter shows how forces calculated in AnyBody can be applied as boundary
conditions to FE Models generated for Abaqus.

Below you see a flowchart of the workflow to go from some medical data to a
Finite Element analysis using AnyBody and Abaqus. In this lesson, we will focus
on the interfacing between AnyBody and Abaqus, where the output file from the
AnyBody Model is converted to an input file readable for Abaqus. This step is
carried out by a small tool called "AnyFE2Abq.exe", which is available at
[AnyBody Technology webpage](https://www.anybodytech.com/resources/customer-downloads#fe-interface-tools). Later in this tutorial, we will go 
through the details of this tool and how to use it.

The model we will look at is a model of the clavicle bone. We will analyze the
muscle forces acting on the clavicle during a simple arm lift and compute the
resulting stresses in the bone. The standard 'Human Standing' model taken from
the AMMR will be used. (Notice, this tutorial was authored with AMMRV3.0.4. It
should run equally well with newer versions of the AMMR, but the results may
vary due to updates of the models.)

We shall focus on the interfacing between AnyBody and Abaqus and therefore we
will use a bone mesh derived from the standard scaled (=unscaled) AnyBody model.
This way, we can skip the step of scaling according to the subject data and in
particular the bone geometry. This would have been needed if the bone model was
derived from scanned data coming from another, significantly different person
than the generic AnyBody model.

## Building the AnyBody Model

Letâ€™s start with the AnyBody model. We have to make sure the FE and AnyBody
models are aligned. The idea is to include local reference frames in both
systems which will be used for all further data transfer. Start by opening the
template 'Human Standing' from the AMMR. For convenience, we will reduce the
model detail by excluding the left arm and switching off the muscles in all body
parts, except the right arm. This is done in the `BodyModelConfiguration.any`
file by inserting the following:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/Model/BodyModelConfiguration.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

Next, we define the local ref frame on the clavicle. All forces will later be
exported with respect to this coordinate system. You can either use a
pre-defined reference system in the AMS or create a new one. The following lines
create a new node located in the Sternoclavicular joint. Insert it in the
`Model\Environment.any` file after the `AnyFixedRefFrame GlobalRef`:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/Model/Environment.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

Now, reloading the model should show the new reference frame in our model, where
the left arm and all muscles, except those in the right arm, are switched off.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image1.png
:alt: clavicula ref frame
:align: center
```

In this lesson, we want to make a FE analysis of the behavior of the clavicle
bone subjected to the applicable forces during a simple arm lift. First, change
the `Mannequin.any` file to create the desired physical activity. We want to
analyze a simple lifting case, so all we specify is flexion in the shoulder
joint. Open the Mannequin file and look for the `PostureVel` folder. Change the
Glenohumeral flexion value to `50/Main.Study.tEnd`, this determines the joint
velocity necessary to reach 50-degree flexion taking into account the simulation
time.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/Model/Mannequin.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

We also want to alter the initial starting position for the motion. In the
`Posture` folder also in the `Mannequin.any` file, make the changes indicated
below.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/Model/Mannequin.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

We want this motion to be done in 10 seconds and analyze 5 time steps. This is
defined in the main file. In the `Study` folder, change the end time of the
study (`tEnd`) to 10 seconds and the number of time steps (`nStep`) to 5.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/AbaqusInterface1.main.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

Now download the prepared Abaqus file {download}`here<Downloads/clavicula.inp>`,
which contains the mesh and geometry of the clavicle bone used in the model.
Save it in your working directory, meaning the folder where your main.any script
is located. Please note that this FE model of the clavicle was created in the
same reference frame as the clavicle model in the AnyBody model since we have
actually used the STL file exported from AMMR for this bone. Therefore,
`localrefframe` does not have to be displaced in order to match with the
coordinate system of the FE mesh. Had the FE mesh been generated based on
scanned data, the registration between AnyBody model's clavicle and the FE mesh
can be entered using `localrefframe`'s sRel and Arel members.

In a similar manner, one could define a local reference frame in Abaqus by means
of the `*SYSTEM` keyword; however, this is not advisable because the AnyFE
Converter does not handle the `*SYSTEM` keyword in the supplied mesh file. We
shall return to the issue of aligning the coordinate systems for the AnyBody
forces and the mesh later, and so far we consider `localrefframe` to be aligned
with the mesh coordinate system.

This figure below shows the clavicle bone mesh used for this tutorial. This bone
is modeled with a reduced stiffness, which can be interpreted as an osteoporotic
bone.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image2.png
:alt: Clavicula mesh
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

## Exporting the Forces

Now we have to specify which forces we want to export to the FE model. For this,
we make use of the Class inserter tab. Place your cursor in the Study folder
below the code shown above and select the 'Classes' tab on the right side of the
AnyBody window. Under the folder 'Class List' search for the class named
"AnyMechOutputFileForceExport" and double-click on it to insert the class
necessary for exporting forces.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/AbaqusInterface1.main.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

Create two new folders in your Human Standing model folder (the folder
containing the main.any script, the Model folder, and so on) named `files_in`
and `files_out`. This will be used to store the FE files. Now change the
inserted `FE_out` object as shown below. These definitions specify that all
forces acting on the segment Clavicula will be written in the xml file
"clavload.xml" and placed in the folder 'files_in'. It is important to use the
xml format since the AnyFE converter only reads this format.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/AbaqusInterface2.main.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

The `UseRefFrameOnOff` option enables the specification of a reference frame in
which all forces and positions are reported. This is set to `on` and the
reference frame is specified to be the one we created before. The
`AllSegmentsInStudyOnOff` option is set to `off`, meaning not all segments in
the study are included, and the `Segments` option then specifies to only include
the clavicula segment.

This object will now write all the muscle and joint forces for all time steps in
one xml file.

We are now ready to execute the AnyFE converter and transform the generic AnyFE
XML file to an Abaqus readable INP file. Download the "AnyFE converter tool for
Abaqus" at the [AnyBody Technology webpage](https://www.anybodytech.com/resources/customer-downloads#fe-interface-tools)
and unpack the files in your working directory folder, meaning the folder where
your main.any script is located. These files include the AnyFE converter, which
is an executable called "AnyFE2Abq.exe". It can convert the xml code to Abaqus
keyword sequence and combine it with the FE model.

For the AnyFE converter to work, you need to place your AnyBody license file in
the same folder as the executable "AnyFE2Abq.exe". To find your license file,
click 'Help' in the top menu of your AnyBody window. Then click
'Registration...' and 'View license status'. A window will open where the
location of your license file is shown under the heading 'License file(s):'. Go
to the file location and copy your license file to the folder where the AnyFE
converter is located. (IMPORTANT: do not delete the original license file when
copying it)

```{image} _static/lesson3/image8.png
:alt: License file location
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

The AnyFE converter is a command line tool with options controlled by program
arguments. You call the converter either from a shell prompt or from inside the
AnyBody system. The latter can be done by inserting the following code, where
the class `AnyOperationShellExec` is used. The names for the executable, its
working directory, and the options for the call of the executable file have to
be given. If you closely followed the tutorial, the paths in `Arguments` should
be correct, but please make sure the paths correspond to your setup, and then
insert the code below your study folder in the main file:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/Lesson3/AbaqusInterface2.main.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

This will enter the operation called `ConvertToAbq` into the model and running
this will execute the AnyFE converter, where the file 'clavload.xml' is the
input, the file 'output.inp' is the output file and the file 'clavicula.inp' is
included in the output file. 

We shall now briefly go through the important options for Arguments for the
AnyFE converter. The `â€“i` option specifies the input AnyFE xml file, which is
the file generated by the class `AnyMechOutputFileForceExport`, and the `-o`
option specifies the output file, which is the files to import in the Abaqus
model. The `â€“m` option is used to specify a FE model without boundary
conditions, which will be included in the output file by means of an
include-statement. In this case, the downloaded Abaqus INP-file
("clavicula.inp"), containing only the mesh, will be included in the converter
output ("output.inp"), also an INP-file.

Another significant option is `â€“e`, which is the radius of muscle/ligament
attachment area. This radius (default value is 1 cm) is used for the
construction of coupling constraint between a loaded point and the surface of
the bone. Please note that this radius is used on all loads applied, not only
muscles and ligaments, but also joint reactions, applied loads, etc. This
parameter is not a physiological parameter. Please also note that in case of
complex concave geometries these constraints may select wrong parts of the bone
surface and may require some manual adjustments.

For more information on the used classes `AnyMechOutputFileForceExport` and
`AnyOperationShellExec`, go to the AnyScript Reference Manual and search for the
two names.

**ðŸ‘‰ Now** you are ready to run the analysis and convert the data. Reload the
Anybody model and run the operation 'RunApplication'. This will automatically
run the 'Calibration' and 'InverseDynamics' studies. Next, run the
'ConvertToAbq' operation. This will create a new Abaqus input file in the
`files_out` folder called "output.inp".

### Using the Shell Prompt and More Details on the AnyFE Converter

You can achieve the same result using the shell prompt by executing the
following command:

```none
AnyFE2Abq.exe -i ..\files_in\clavload.xml -o ..\files_out\output.inp -m .\clavicula.inp
```

At this point, let us return to the issue of the coordinate systems that we have
used so far and an alternative option. In the example, we have exported all the
positions and forces with reference to a given manually defined system attached
to the clavicle, i.e. the 'localrefframe'. The AnyFE converter will by default
transfer all positions and forces directly, i.e., in the same coordinate system
as exported the AnyFE XML file. In the above, we have therefore considered
'localrefframe' to be the coordinate system of the FE model, which is also the
CT/MRI scan system. Notice that in the given case, the segment reference and the
output reference are aligned since the FE mesh was based on the original bone
geometry from the AnyBody model, i.e. `sRel= {0, 0, 0}`.

As an alternative, you can export the AnyFE XML file in another reference frame,
even the global system in AnyBody (`UseRefFrameOnOff=Off`) for that matter. This
implies that the data of the AnyFE XML file may or may not contain motion of the
bone and it will probably not be aligned with the FE mesh/CT/MRI scan system. If
you chose this option, the AnyFE Converter can remove the rigid body motion by
using the `â€“r` option equal to 'segment':

```none
AnyFE2Abq.exe -i ..\files_in\clavload.xml -o ..\files_out\output.inp -m .\clavicula.inp â€“r segment
```

This makes all AnyFE data from the AnyFE Converter being transformed to the
local frame of the segment, here the clavicle segment, before applied to the FE
model and outputted.

If the reference frame of the segment is not identical to the one of the FE
mesh, one can apply a constant transformation to all data accommodating for this
misalignment. The `â€“t` option allows you to enter the transformation as a string
containing space-separated numbers. The command line will look like:

```none
AnyFE2Abq.exe -i ..\files_in\clavload.xml -o ..\files_out\output.inp -m .\clavicula.inp â€“r segment â€“t "a11 a12 a13 a21 a22 a23 a31 a32 a33 dx dy dz"
```

The transformation may contain either 9 or 12 numbers. The first nine, aij, must
be the orthogonal rotational transformation matrix and the latter optional
three, dx, dy, and dz, are the translations.

These options allow you to handle the coordinate systems differences using the
AnyFE Converter, i.e., outside AnyBody. For instance, this implies that you do
not have to redo simulations just to apply the same forces to another FE mesh
with another local frame; this can all be done with adjustment of the parameters
for the AnyFE converter.

However, in this tutorial, we will not use these options to specify another
reference frame, so you do not need to include the `â€“r` and `â€“t` options. Now
that we have looked at how to execute the AnyFE converter properly, let's have a
closer look at what it does.

Please notice that the AnyFE Converter is reading the Abaqus input file (INP)
and it is only expecting a simple mesh specification. This reader is not fully
compatible with the INP keyword language for Abaqus. Basically, it only reads in
the first block of nodes (`*NODE` section) and it does not accept commands that
may interfere with the interpretation of this node section. This implies that
many Abaqus keywords are not allowed in front of the first node section. This
also implies that subsequent node sections are not read and therefore, not used
for application of forces.

When the AnyFE Converter is executed, it performs the following actions:

- Maps all AnyBody exported forces, i.e., joint reactions, muscle
  forces and applied forces to the provided FE mesh. Mass related
  forces are neglected, i.e., gravitational and acceleration equivalent
  forces.

  - Defines nodes in the positions from the AnyFE output file, i.e.
    the position of all loads (this includes muscle/ligament
    attachment nodes)
  - Defines amplitudes for each force/moment component in the AnyFE
    output file
  - Defines concentrated loads (`*CLOAD`) in each of these nodes
  - Defines coupling constraints between the created nodes and a part
    of the surface of the bone

- Includes the mesh 

- Adds inertia relief loads (`*INERTIA RELIEF`)

Please note that the inertia relief loads will automatically be added to the
model in order to provide a full set of boundary conditions. However, these
loads require a density value in the material definition section (which already is
defined in the downloaded 'clavicula.inp' file). Absence of this density value
will result in an error during the FE analysis. In case when additional
constraints are present in the model, e.g. environment support, contact with
another bone, etc., the inertia loads can be suppressed or removed.

## Importing and Modifying the Model in Abaqus

Open Abaqus and import the input file from the `files_out` folder as a Model.
This will load the clavicula mesh model and apply the boundary conditions
exported from the AnyBody Model. The Abaqus model is now ready to run the finite
element analysis directly and then post-process the results. You can also make
custom adjustments to the model before running. The image below shows the
results of running the model without any custom adjustments, where the von Mises
stress plot can be seen.

In the following picture, you can see the muscle attachments nodes and coupling
constraints that are applied to the finite element model. These are found under
the 'Constraints' folder in Abaqus. Each group of yellow lines defines one
muscle attachment by a point and a surface area on the model to attach, and
corresponds to a similar muscle attachment in the AnyBody model.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image4.png
:alt: Clavicula force application points
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

:::{Note} 
By comparing the muscle attachment in the Abaqus model with the muscle
attachment in the AnyBody model, you can see that the sternocleidomastoid muscle
attachment is missing in the Abaqus model. This is because the AnyFE Converter
**excludes all muscles that carry zero load**, when generating the Abaqus input
file. 
:::

Bear in mind that the muscle attachment area is considered to have a constant
radius, however, in reality, these areas are often elongated and have an
irregular pattern. To better fit the userâ€™s expectations, for example, to be
more physiological, each constraint can be modified. That can be done by
defining the desired muscle attachment area as a new surface in the Abaqus model
and changing the relevant coupling constraint to refer to this surface. When
doing this, it is important to set the influence radius option to 'To outermost
point of the region' when editing the constraint, to make sure that all points
on the specified surface area are included in the constraint.
