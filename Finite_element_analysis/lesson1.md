# Lesson 1: Export of data for FEA

```{image} _static/lesson1/image1.jpeg

```

In this example we want to shed some light on an important issue for all
aquarium owners: What‚Äôs the magnitude of stress in the lumbar vertebra
L5 during lifting of a 10 kg aquarium?

First, we need a model to work on.

With the AnyBody Modeling System you already have a repository of models
available. For details please see the AnyBody Assistant available from
the menu. This tutorial was written using the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository Ver. 1.6 (AMMRV1.6). If you see differences between the
tutorial text and your own results please [report or help fix it here.](https://github.com/anybody/tutorials/)

The starting point for this tutorial is the model:

{file}`Applications/Examples/StandingLift/StandingLiftFEA.main.any`

However, this model internally reuses the code of {file}`StandingLift.main.any`. Please
find the model and load it by pressing F7, and open a Model View. You
should see something similar to the picture above. The vertebral
body we want to analyze is marked with a square in the zoomed-in
picture.

```{image} _static/lesson1/image2.jpeg
:alt: L5 L4 joint
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
:width: 35%
```

As mentioned before, this model is based on the ‚ÄúStandingLift‚Äù model of
the AMMR Repository. It is a full body model lifting a box of 10 kg and
therefore also imposing forces on the spine. In this tutorial we will be
using a more basic representation of the L5 vertebra than the one
included in the repository model. Our tutorial model lacks the pedicles
and facet joints, consisting only of the vertebral body. This is done
to simplify the FEA-related processes, which will be discussed
later.

Another simplification will be that we only use the model with joint
generating muscles; this will keep the force output files small. Go to 
`StandingLift.main.any -> Model/BodyModelConfigurationFEA.any` to see the code
applying this simplification.

```{literalinclude} FEM_Interfacing_model/Model/BodyModelConfigurationFEA.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

## Exporting the Forces

In order to export the forces acting on the vertebra we had to include
the output function. This modification can be found inside the
Study folder of the main file:

```{literalinclude} FEM_Interfacing_model/StandingLift.main.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

The `AllSegmentsInStudyOnOff` switch decides if only the forces of the
listed segments will be exported or data from all segments in the
study. Usually you will only use a selected amount of data to keep the
file manageable. The following segment points to the L5 segment which
is the one we want to analyze. If the path is not already inserted, you 
can fill in the path by browsing the Model tab to the L5 segment, 
right-click it, and choose ‚ÄúInsert Object Name‚Äù in the drop down menu.

That‚Äôs all we have to do for the force export. Please reload the
model by pressing F7 and run an "InverseDynamicsAnalysis".
The model will analyze one timestep and write
the "FEAoutput.txt" file which we have specified earlier. Let‚Äôs take a
closer look at the output file. It is located inside your Application
folder in the Output subfolder. You can open it either directly in
AnyBody or in any text editor of your choice.

```{literalinclude} FEM_Interfacing_model/Output/ForceL5.txt
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

It starts with information on the included segment, listing all geometrical 
entries in the global coordinate system. Following this, all forces acting 
on the segment are listed, including the position and components of each 
force from AnyBody. The underlying "Class" entry indicates the type of AnyForce, 
which can have various components. An AnyForce may have
any number of components, which may be a physical force or a torque,
but it may also be a more generalized load, not measured in Newtons or
Newton-meters.

These force components are related to the underlying kinematic measure, 
meaning force times kinematic displacement equals work/energy; in other words, 
the kinematic measure determines the unit of the force component. These 
force measures present in the Anybody model are converted to real point forces 
and torques in the AnyFE output file, represented as `F[i]` and `M[i]`. These 
are the point force and the point torque associated with the *i*'th
component of the given AnyForce object. The total force acting in the
global direction at any given point is the sum of all `F[i]` components.

In many cases, the components are indeed simple such that component `i=0`
for instance is `Fx` as could be expected. However, since this `Fx` may refer to
a local coordinate system of a particular segment, a joint attachment
node, or the like, `F[i]` and `M[i]` may still have three non-zero values
when exported to the AnyFE file. This is because the data is transformed
while being exported so that the AnyFE refers to a single
coordinate system for all of the exported data; this system is often (by
default) the global coordinate system, bit it can also be a local coordinate
system.

Let us have a look at the following entry which essentially provides the
joint constraints in the L5-Sacrum joint:

```{literalinclude} FEM_Interfacing_model/Output/ForceL5.txt
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

You can see the three moments have zero values. This is
because this joint is discretized as a spherical joint
which therefore cannot take up moments. Similarly, all other
joints are handled.

## Exporting the Geometry

Next we need an object where we can apply our exported forces. This is
also quite simple. A facility is built in the system (from Version
3.1) which allows the export of all .anysurf and .stl geometries from
your application in the .stl file format. The function will export the
geometry in its actual position, so please make sure that your model
has not been reloaded since the force export. Otherwise run the
InverseDynamicAnalysis again to bring it to the right position. Of course
it also involves all scaling that has been applied to the bones.

Browse through the model tree to the L5Seg
`Main/HumanModel/BodyModel/Trunk/SegmentsLumbar/L5Seg` in order
to export the L5 segment. Inside this folder you find the DrwSTL
folder. Right-click the folder and choose ‚ÄúExport Surface‚Äù. Choose a
convenient place to store the file and give it the name ‚ÄúL5.stl‚Äù. A
dialog box will appear that allows you to specify a scaling factor for
the output file. The scaling can be useful to switch from one unit
system to another. In our case, we have meters as units in the AMS, but want
to have millimeters for the FE geometry. So choose a scaling factor of 1000. After
clicking OK a new dialog box will appear that allows you to select a
reference frame. Choose "Global" and click OK. From the AnyBody point of view, 
that‚Äôs all we have to do. 

:::{note}
Please note that not all bones currently 
in the Repository may be suitable for a FEA. As the main intention is to have 
a graphical representation of the body, it may appear that some bone are simply 
too coarse for a detailed analysis. But of course you are free to import your own .stl
file into the AnyBody Modeling System to substitute existing bones.
You will have to tweak your CAD file a bit in order to make it fit.
[Donation of better quality CAD files of bones to the models¬†is most
welcome.](mailto:support@anybodytech.com)
:::

Based on the exported forces and `.stl` file we can now build and analyze
a finite element (FE) model. Below, we shall build an FE model by manually 
applying the loads and other boundary conditions using non-commercially 
available software. However, please note that in the following lessons, we
consider more smooth integration with selected commercial software by
means of small converter software tools provided by AnyBody Technology.
These tools automatically convert the AnyFE output file from AnyBody to
input files for the particular FE software.

After building a FE model based on this data the internal stress in
the bone tissue can be evaluated. 

## ¬†Building the Finite Element Model

In this section a short description of how to build a finite element
model using AnyBody data is given. If you are an experienced FE user
you may want to skip this section.

As this is by no means a Finite Element tutorial we will use
some shortcuts to achieve our goal: We have already restricted the analyses
to one time step. Further, we will only take the joint reaction forces
into account. How to can handle muscle forces will be discussed
below. And finally, the geometry used was simplified. Essentially, only
the vertebral body is used. The main reason for this is to avoid
getting lost in the jungle of meshing.

In the following, we will make use of a freely available software 
- [FEBio](https://febio.org/downloads/). This software can handle the preprocessing 
(meshing and applying boundary conditions), solve the FE anlysis and handle the
post-processing of the FE model. 
Please note that this program is in no relation to AnyBody Technology.

Please follow the link shown above to download and install the program, if 
you want to do some hands-on FEA.

### Building the Model - Preprocessing

A file with the finished model is provided below, in case you do not
want to go through the entire model building process.

**üëâ Now** Open FEBio and start a New Model. Select 'Structural Mechanics', give your 
model an appropriate name, e.g. "StandingLiftFE", and select 'mm-kg-s' as unit system. 

```{image} _static/lesson1/image4.jpeg
:alt: Open new Model
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

To open the earlier exported `.stl` file of the geometry, select 'Import Geometry' 
under 'File' and browse to the location of your STL-file. 

After successful loading the geometry we have to generate a mesh. The geometry
already has an initial mesh based on the stl file, but we want to refine and 
specify it. This is done by first right-clicking on the name 
"L5-stl" in the Model Tree, choosing "Select" and clicking on the geometry in the model view. 
This opens the Build panel to the right where you can choose Mesh and convert Type to 
'Editable mesh', which allows us to change the mesh. 

Under Edit Mesh click on MMG Remesh, which is a tool to re-create the mesh or 
apply a local mesh refinement or coarsening on a mesh.
Under parameters set Element size to 8, Min element size to 2, 
Global Hausdorff value to 0.05 and Gradation to 1.3. Click Apply to generate 
this new mesh.

```{image} _static/lesson1/image5.jpeg
:alt: Open new Model
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

After this we have to assign material properties to the model. Right-click on 
Materials in the Model Tree, select Add Material and choose 'Isotropic 
elastic' as the type. This adds a new material which we now have to specify. Click on 
the newly added material to open the info tab. Reasonable values for bone material 
could be to set the Density to 1.3e-09 kg/mm^3, the Young's modulus to 1e+06 kPa, 
and the Poisson's ratio to 0.3. Under Geometry -> Objects -> L5.stl -> Parts click on 
each part, and under Properties apply Material 1 as the material for all parts. 

```{image} _static/lesson1/image7.jpeg
:alt: Open new Model
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
:width: 70%
```

The material selection used is an approximation of the real bone, but of course 
you may also want to model the bone in more detail, separating the cortical shell 
and the cancellous bone or even basing the material properties on density data. But 
this is surely not within the scope of this tutorial.

In this example we will apply only the joint reaction forces on the endplates. Therefore 
we will not make explicit use of all the information given by the AnyBody force 
export file. So we have to select two sets of nodes to apply the boundary conditions.

Start by right-clicking on Boundary Conditions in the Model Tree and selecting Add Nodal BC. 
Choose 'Zero Displacement' and under Property check out x-, y-, and z-displacement. Next, select 
an area of element faces on the buttom endplate, similar to the selection on image below, to apply 
this boundary condition. To do this, click on the part in the model view, choose 'Select faces' 
and 'Select connected', both in the Graphics control bar (highlighted  with a red square in the image 
below), and select an element face. If this does not automatically select all the element faces, 
simply hold the shift button down while manually selecting multiple faces. Finally, add the selected faces 
by clicking the plus sign under Selection.

```{image} _static/lesson1/image8.jpeg
:alt: BC selection
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
:width: 80%
```

Now the force must be applied. For this we need our force export file. Please open 
the file (it should be located in your StandingLiftFEA application folder) in an 
editor and scroll down to Force[14]. This force is the joint reaction on the L5-Sacrum joint.

```{literalinclude} FEM_Interfacing_model/Output/ForceL5.txt
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

By summing up the rows for the forces `F[0]`, `F[1]`, and `F[2]` we get the
resulting components for the joint reaction load. This can be directly
used in the force definition since they are given in the same coordinate
system. In this case only the Y-force component is of interest as all
other forces are small in comparison when summing them up. Now right-click on 
'Loads' in the Model Tree and select 'Add Surface Load' and choose 'Force' in the pop-up 
window. Set the Force to {0, 488000, 0} mN and apply it to an area of element faces, 
similar to what you did for the boundary condition selection, but on the opposite endplate.

Finally, we need to create an analysis step and change the load controller to define what type of 
analysis we want to do and how the loads are applied.
Add an analysis step by selecting 'Physics' -> 'Add Analysis Step' from the top menu and then click OK.
Since we want to perform a static analysis, we keep all settings under 'Properties' as they are. 
Now, expand 'Load Controllers', select the Load Controller LC1 in the model tree and under 'Properties' 
make sure the 'Type' is set to 'Linear'. (You should only have one Load Controller in the model. If you have more, 
delete the ones with an exclamation mark)

### Solving and Post-Processing

Congratulations! The model is now finished. Now we have to run and solve the FE model.

First, save the model if you have not already done so. Then, click on the 'FEBio' icon in the top menu 
and select 'Run FEBio'. In the pop-up window define the Job name (could be "StandingLiftFE_run"), 
make sure the 'Launch Configuration' is set to 'Default'. Finally, click 'Run' to start the analysis.

The analysis should only take a few seconds, and a pop-up window will appear when the analysis is finished.
Here the 'Status' should say 'Normal Termination' and 'Completion' 100%. 
Click on 'Open results' to see the simulation outputs.

You have many options to visualize the results. To learn more about the FEBio post-processing go to 
[the FEBio Knowledgebase](https://febio.org/knowledgebase/).
One option is to plot the von Mises stress in the model. To do this, click on 'Color Map' 
in the Post menu. Under 'Properties' change 'Data Field' to Stress -> Effective stress, 
'Show Legend' to 'Yes', and both 'Max range type' and 'Min range type' to 'Static'. 
Now click the Play buttom ![Play](_static/lesson1/image10.jpeg) in the top menu to show the von Mises 
stress plot in the model. 

The below image shows this stress plot with a planecut through 
the middle of the vertebral body to show the internal stresses at this cut.

```{image} _static/lesson1/image9.jpeg
:alt: Stress Plot

```

With a maximum stress of approximately 2.7 MPa in the bone we are
far away from the yield strength. So we can conclude that it
appears to be ok for aquarium owners to lift their pets in an
aquarium¬†of this size. But of course we did some generous shortcuts to achieve this goal and
neglected a lot of detail which is provided by the AnyBody Modeling System.

This completes Lesson 1. The final FEBio model can be downloaded {download}`here <Downloads/FEBioDownload.zip>`.

In the following lessons, we show somewhat more automatic interfaces to
selected commercial FE packages using small interface tools.
