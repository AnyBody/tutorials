<h1>Lesson 5: Using real data<a class="headerlink" href="#lesson-5-using-real-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Without further ado, let us import a C3D file and drive a model. The
AnyBody Modeling System offers you virtually unlimited ways of doing
things, and probably more than the average user can comprehend, so we
are going to start with a simple and top-down procedure: Version 1.2 of
the AnyScript Managed Model Repository, on which this tutorial is built,
which comes with the installation of AnyBody, contains two pre-cooked
models that are very easy to drive with your own data and which contain
some really neat features for data processing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Go to the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">ApplicationExamples</span></code> folder to find a folder called
MoCapModel.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a copy of the entire folder and call it something else, for
instance MyMoCapModel. You may even want to place it in a new
directory parallel to <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">ApplicationExamples</span></code>, for instance
<code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">ApplicationMyModels</span></code>, to avoid polluting the original examples.
Please note that you have to put a copy of the libdef.any file into
the new directory in that case.</p></li>
<li><p>Browse into the MyMoCapModel folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the file <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">MoCap_LowerBody.main.any</span></code> in the AnyBody Modeling
System.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As the name indicates, this is a gait model comprising only the lower
extremities and the necessary part of the upper body for attachment of
muscles. The motion imposed on the original model is gait over three
force platforms, but you can easily modify this to any other movement,
simply by importing a different C3D file to drive the model with.</p>
<p>In the top of the file you find a brief description of the procedure.
Don’t worry about that for now, but browse a little further down to find
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//***************************</span>

<span class="c1">//***************************</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These lines define the two model executions that you normally have to
perform to process a new data set. When
MotionAndParameterOptimizationModel=1, the system performs an
optimization of the model to fit the C3D data you have recorded. This is
much more than simply making the model follow the marker trajectories;
it also optimizes the model parameters such as segment lengths and
marker placements, based on the recorded data.</p>
<p>If InverseDynamicModel=1, then the system performs an actual dynamic
analysis based on the parameters identified in the
MotionAndParameterOptimization step.</p>
<p>Please make sure you have set the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//**************************************************</span>

<span class="o">/**************************************************</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now please load the model and open up a new Model View. You should see
the following skeleton without arms:</p>
<p><img alt="Model view initial load" src="../_images/image131.png" /></p>
<p>If you look closely, you can see that the skeleton is equipped with
markers and if you zoom in a little, you can also see that the markers
carry small coordinate systems with red and green arrows.</p>
<p><img alt="Model view leg closeup" src="../_images/image224.png" /></p>
<p>These are the marker points defined on the human body, and the red and
green arrows designate directions in which the marker position is fixed
versus free to be optimized. A free marker position is one that is not
well-known by the clinician.</p>
<p>So why would we be in doubt about the position of a marker that we have
placed? Well, clinicians place markers on the skin at an unknown
distance from the bone, and even when a marker is placed on a bony
landmark just below the skin, we are never quite sure which point that
corresponds to in the bone’s local coordinate system. If we get those
points wrong, the resulting motion of the model will also be inaccurate.</p>
<p>So the green arrows designate directions in which we have the greatest
uncertainty about whether the marker is placed in the model as it was in
the experiment. The good news is that we can optimize those marker
placements exactly as we did in <a class="reference internal" href="lesson4.html"><span class="doc">lesson 4</span></a>. The model
is set up to do this automatically, and if you are happy with the choice
that has been made, you need not do anymore. Of course, if you use a
different marker protocol there will be additional setting up to do, but
only once until you have determined the parameterization that fits your
protocol. In the interest of simplicity, we shall postpone the
discussion of marker protocol setup.</p>
<p>In addition to the marker coordinates, the model considers the segment
lengths to be variable, so the computation we are about to do will also
automatically figure out how long the segments are, and thereby where
the joints are placed. Pretty much any parameter in a model can be made
variable but not all parameters will be determined well by the marker
trajectory data and not all parameters can be determined at the same
time because the mocap data only contains limited information and
because some parameters can create mutual indeterminacies. For instance,
if the model has no movement of a specific joint, then it is not
possible to get information about the location of that joint or about
the lengths of adjacent segments from the marker data.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let us perform the optimization:</p>
<p>In the Operation Tree you find the
MotionAndParameterOptimizationSequence. Select it and click the “Run”
button.</p>
<p><img alt="Operation. MotionAndParameterOptimizationSequence" src="../_images/image323.png" /></p>
<p>You will see the model walking repeatedly over the force platforms,
sometimes slowly and sometimes a bit faster depending on the speed of
your computer and the progress of the computation. The optimization will
take a few minutes to complete and it is speeded up significantly if you
switch the Model View update off during the process. The final message
you get is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#### Macro command &gt; classoperation Main.Studies.ParameterIdentification &quot;Save design&quot; --file=&quot;GaitNormal0003-processed-OptimizedParametersTest.txt&quot;
Main.Studies.ParameterIdentification : Saving design...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It means that things have gone fine, the optimization has converged, and
the optimized values of the variable parameters have been saved on a
text file for later use.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let us ponder for a moment when it is necessary to
perform this optimization. The results of the optimization in summary
are the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Updated anthropometrical parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Updated marker locations.</p></li>
<li><p>The movement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Within a brief time we can safely presume that the first is constant for
a particular test subject. This means that if we have once and for all
determined and saved the anthropometrical parameters of this subject,
then we probably need not include them in the optimization again.</p>
<p>We can usually presume that the marker locations on the body are
constant within a given trial or series of trials performed with the
same subject with the same markers attached. However, if the markers
have been detached or relocated, then obviously the optimization of
marker positions must be done again.</p>
<p>Finally, the movement is different for each trial, so this part of the
optimization we have to do again for each new recording. However, for
most cases, the computational effort of performing the optimization with
all the parameters is modest, to the casual user may elect to simply
redo the full optimization for each trial as we shall do later in this
tutorial.</p>
<p>Let us now run the actual inverse dynamics analysis. We must first
change the settings in the main file:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//************************************************</span>
<span class="c1">//Set this to one if you want to run the motion and Parameter Optimization identification</span>

<span class="c1">//Usually only have one of the two switches active</span>
<span class="c1">//************************************************</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After reload, a new model including muscles and a new operation are
available:</p>
<p><img alt="Operation, InverseDynamicAnalysisSequence" src="../_images/image419.png" /></p>
<p>This operation contains everything that is necessary to run the
analysis: It loads the optimized model parameters that were saved
previously; if necessary, it performs calibration movements to adjust
the tendon lengths to the lengths of the bones; and finally executes a
dynamic analysis to determine forces in the system. Click the
InverseDynamicAnalysisSequence and then click the “Run” button.</p>
<p>The model starts walking across the force platforms. It walks slowly due
to the very high amount of detail of the model, requiring the computer
to continuously calculate forces in more than 300 muscles. When the
analysis is finished, you can open up a Chart view and investigate the
results, for instance the hip joint reaction forces:</p>
<p><img alt="Chartivew hip reactions" src="../_images/image514.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="importing-new-motion-data">
<h2>Importing new motion data<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-new-motion-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So we have seen the model optimize its parameters and we have seen it
perform a dynamic analysis on existing data that somebody else has
defined. But here comes the real point of the application:</p>
<p><strong>Processing a different motion is exactly the same</strong>!</p>
<p>All we have to do is to replace the C3D file containing the motion data.
The MoCapModel folder already contains a few C3D files located in the
subfolder Input that we can try. All we have to do is to make the model
point at a different file. A few lines into the Main file, you find
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="s">&quot;TrialSpecificData.any&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This file contains the settings you typically want to change when</p>
<p>Double-click the TrialSpecificData.any file name, and the file opens up
in a new window. Then, just a few lines down, refer to the new filename
into the model:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//Name of the C3D file to be analysed</span>
<span class="kt">AnyString</span> <span class="n">NameOfFile</span> <span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;§GaitFast0001-processed§&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">//Write the name of the file here</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since this is a new C3D file from a new trial, we also need to run the
kinematic optimization again, so we change the setting in the main file
back to the MotionAndParameterOptimization option:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//Set this to 1 if you want to run the motion and Parameter Optimization identification</span>
<span class="c1">//************************************************</span>
<span class="cp">#define</span> <span class="n">MotionAndParameterOptimizationModel</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="c1">//Set this to 1 if you want to run the inverse dynamic analysis</span>
<span class="cp">#define</span> <span class="n">InverseDynamicModel</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is all there is to it. We can now reload the model. To see the
model moving (without doing the parameter optimization just now), locate
and run the Kinematics operation in the Operation tree:</p>
<p><img alt="Operations, kinematics" src="../_images/image68.png" /></p>
<p>The movement seems to work fine and you will notice that this gait
pattern is a little different from before. The steps are longer and the
posture indicates that this is a person in a hurry.</p>
<p><img alt="Model view, marker tracking" src="../_images/image75.png" /></p>
<p>Now is the time to run the MotionAndParameterOptimizationSequence. It
takes a bit of time, and again you can speed up the process by switching
off the update of the Model View window. Eventually, the process comes
to an end and you get the message:</p>
<div class="highlight-none"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Optimization converged

#### Macro command &gt; run
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So we can change the model setting in the Main file again, reload and
run the actual analysis, i.e. the InverseDynamicAnalysisSequence
operation:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">//************************************************</span>

</div>
<p>Which, after the analysis can provide a new hip joint force profile
documenting that faster gait leadt to higher hip joint forces.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-full-body-models">
<h2>Using full-body models<a class="headerlink" href="#using-full-body-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many motion experiments deal with the entire body as opposed to just the
lower extremities. The AnyScript Model Repository contains another
pre-cooked model for this purpose, and it will reveal that there is more
data in the C3D file we just imported than we saw in the
MoCap_LowerBody model.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can use the MoCap_FullBody model from the directory we
copied before. In MoCap_FullBody.main.any, make sure the
MotionAndParameterOptimizationModel is the active operation:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Please load the model and open a Model View if you do not already have
one. You will see the model as before, but now with the arms included.</p>
<p><img alt="Model view Fullbody initial load" src="../_images/image91.png" /></p>
<p>Select and run the RunMotionAndParameterOptimizationSequence in the
Operations tree:</p>
<p><img alt="Opertions RunModtionAndParameterOpt" src="../_images/image101.png" /></p>
<p>The model starts walking repeatedly over the force platforms including
the arm motions while it tries to optimize segment lengths and marker
positions. It takes three iterations and a little more time than before
to optimize the model because this is a much larger problem, but as
before you can speed up the process if you switch off the update of the
Model View Window. It is possible to monitor the convergence of the
optimization problem from a Chart window like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Chart view, Kin objective" src="../_images/image1110.png" /></p>
<p>Eventually, the optimization process terminates and you can switch to
the InverseDynamicAnalysis:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>… and perform the analysis of the entire body including the muscle
forces. This full-body model with almost 1000 muscles included takes
considerable time to analyze but will reward you with very detailed
information about the function of the muscle system in gait as
illustrated below.</p>
<p><img alt="Model view, full body inverse dynamics" src="../_images/image1210.png" /></p>
