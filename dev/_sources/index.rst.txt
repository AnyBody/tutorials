Welcome to AnyBody Tutorials's documentation!
=============================================


Overview
--------

This page introduces each of the tutorials briefly in order to provide
an overview. The tutorials are ordered in a suitable sequence for many
new users unfamiliar with AnyBody, but this sequence may not be optimal
for you depending on your background and interests. Thus, this overview
may be helpful for you to plan your way.

It can be recommended to start with the Getting Started tutorials, of
which there are four.

Getting started (Demo Model)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate some of the features of
the AnyBody Modeling System using an existing model. The reader will get
an impression of the system’s capabilities and see a complex
musculoskeletal model in action.

Getting started: The model repository (AMMR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository (AMMR) and give an overview of default Body Models and demo
applications available. Many of the following tutorials will focus on
adapting existing and creating new applications models.

Getting started: AnyScript Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial introduces the AnyScript modeling language, which is used
for all modeling in AnyBody. The reader will get an understanding of the
structure of the language, and key modeling objects such as segments,
joints, muscles, kinematics and forces will be illustrated. A basic
“arm” model will be created from scratch with two segments, joints and
applied motion and forces. Once you’ll feel confident with these
concepts you should move on to the next chapter “Getting started:
Modeling” to create a more anatomically realistic model using the full
body model in the AMMR.

Getting started: Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial explains the design of complex biomechanical models
starting from a full body model from the model repository. A model will
be created from a template and the model will adapted to explain the
reaction of the human body to an environment.

User interface features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to give an overview of the different
user interface features in the AnyBody Modeling System, including the
features of the Editor Window, the Model View, the various Model Tree
representations, and the graphing options. Most of this tutorial is
about the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of AnyBody (AnyBody.exe), but
the console application interface (AnyBodyCon.exe) is also considered
briefly.

A study of studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In AnyBody, all types of analysis, whether pure mechanical system
analysis, musculoskeletal analysis or design analysis, are carried out
by objects that are referred to as "studies". Studies have operations
that can be executed to perform the analysis. The objective of this
tutorial is to explain the sequence of a typical study from its
mechanical system information, to the initial conditions, kinematics to
the inverse dynamic analysis.

Making things move
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to give an overview of the different
possibilities to apply a motion to a body model. In the following
lessons the different drivers from simple drivers to using motion
capture data will be explained.

Inverse dynamics of muscle systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial introduces what muscle recruitment is and demonstrates the
different types of recruitment solvers available in the AnyBody Modeling
System.

Force dependent kinematics (FDK)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to explain a feature of the AnyBody
Modeling System called force-dependent kinematics. This advanced feature
allows the user to alter motion in a joint depending on the acting
forces from muscles, ligaments, surfaces, etc. This is particularly
useful for modeling non-conforming joints and it also has important
applications for other types of models.

Muscle Modeling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-

This tutorial introduces the many facilities for modeling muscles in the
AnyBody Modeling System. It includes the different options for muscle
types and muscle models, and furthermore introduces ligament modeling.

The mechanical elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial demonstrates many of the mechanical objects available in
AnyScript, such as segments, joints, drivers, forces, and the very
versatile kinematic measures.

Advanced script features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to show some additional advanced
features of the AnyBody Modeling System.

Finite element analysis interfacing tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial introduces the interface between the AnyBody Modeling
System and Finite Element systems. Forces and segments from a model in
AnyBody will be exported to provide the boundary conditions of a finite
element model. Special interface are available for Ansys and Abaqus, but
the generic output available to interface with other system is also
considered.

Making Models using SolidWorks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial shows how a CAD model designed in SolidWorks can be
imported into AnyBody and interact with the human model. This allows for
analysis and optimization of the ergonomics of products.

Scaling
~~~~~~~

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce the different methods for
scaling the generic human body model in the AnyBody Modeling System. It
explains also how real bone geometries from e.g. CT\_Scans can be used
to create fully subject-specific models.

Validation of Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial explains the setup of model validation studies in which
models can be verified and validated by comparison with empirical data.

Parameter studies and optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial introduces parameter and optimization studies, which are
used to investigate the influence of model parameters and optimize them
to obtain a desired model behavior.
