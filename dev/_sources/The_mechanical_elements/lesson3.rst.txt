Lesson 3: Drivers
=================

Drivers create movement in a model. They are really functions of time
determining the position of a joint or the distance between two points
or some other kinematic measure at any given time through the simulation
period.

There are various drivers available to create different types of time
dependency. For a demonstration of the different types, please :download:`download
and study the Driver demo <Downloads/Demo.Drivers.any>`.
