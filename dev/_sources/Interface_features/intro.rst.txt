**We also strongly recommend watching the introductory video found in
Help -> AnyBody Assistant, which visually demonstrates several important
GUI features.**

Please go to the CrossTrainer example from the AnyBody Managed Model
Repository and open the CrossTrainer.main.any file. **Load the model
into AnyBody by pressing F7 or using the “Load” button in the toolbar.**
