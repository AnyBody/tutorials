    Lesson 1 <lesson1>
    Lesson 2 <lesson2>
    Lesson 3 <lesson3>

This tutorial demonstrates the use of AnyBody's modeling interface to
the SOLIDWORKS CAD system. This interface, called AnyBody Exporter™ for
SOLIDWORKS® (AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS™), is an add-in for SOLIDWORKS, which
allows export of SOLIDWORKS assembly models to AnyBody.

SOLIDWORKS and AnyBody, now linked via this interface, is a powerful
combination if you want to design and analyze mechanical systems with a
close relationship with human. It is convenient to manage the model of
your system in the CAD system with its powerful design functionality and
then transfer the model to AnyBody for human-integrated mechanical
analysis. AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS makes this transfer of the model easy.

After finalizing your CAD model, then with the AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS add-in
you can translate it into a corresponding AnyScript model. This
AnyScript model will include all mass properties, initial positions and
geometry information of all individual parts in your CAD assembly. Also
all the mate information of your CAD assembly will be translated into
several corresponding AnyScript constraint objects.

This tutorial comprises the following lessons:

-  :doc:`Lesson 1: ‘Translating a SOLIDWORKS CAD model to
   AnyBody <lesson1>`\ ’. This lesson is the basic demo of how to
   operate AnyExp4SOLIDWORKS.

-  :doc:`Lesson 2: ‘Making the translated AnyScript model
   move <lesson2>`\ ’. Here we study the translated AnyScript
   model and learn how to add some user-defined drivers to make it move.

-  :doc:`Lesson 3: ‘Adding the human to the model <lesson3>`\ ’. In
   this lesson we add an AnyBody human model to the model translated
   from SOLIDWORKS and make kinematic and kinetic connections between
   the two model parts.
