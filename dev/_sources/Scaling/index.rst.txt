Subject Specific Scaling
=========================

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce custom and subject specific
scaling.  It explains  how real bone geometries from e.g. CT Scans can be used
to create fully subject-specific models.

Musculoskeletal models must be scalable to sizes of different individuals to be
useful for product design. A general method for scaling musculoskeletal models
has been implemented into the AnyBody Respository models. The scaling procedure
is implemented in a generic manner and allows the usage of user-defined scaling
laws. 

.. seealso:: The AMMR documentation for instructions on how to use some of the 
   scaling laws which are builtin to the AMMR.

This tutorial covers the more advanced topics of user-defined custom scaling based on 
CT/MRI imaging.
