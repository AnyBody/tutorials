How to get the AMMR?
====================

**From the “AnyBody Assistant” press the Demo tab to install a copy of
the AMMR to your Documents folder. It is possible to reset the AMMR from
the demo tab, so be careful not to overwrite any existing work! To
prevent this, it is good practice to create a second local copy of your
own models.**

If you are interested in beta models/repositories that have not been
integrated into the AMMR yet, please visit
`www.anyscript.org <http://www.anyscript.org>`__.

Please notice that demo files are NOT installed during the AnyBody
installation because they must be available independently (not shared)
for every user of the computer.
