<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The following tutorial will explain how to set up your simple
calibration study. Calibration is already built into the AMMR,
:ammr:doc`see the AMMR documentation &lt;index&gt;` for more details.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the challenges in body modeling is that models must be able to change
size to reflect individuals of different statures. Even if you are working on a
model of a particular individual, you will almost always want to change the
dimensions of the model as you are building it. And if you are developing a
generic model to represent a range of body proportions, you are likely to want
the model to depend on the anthropometrical parameters you define. For instance,
the weight of a segment is often represented as some fraction of the full body
weight. Such a property you could make parametric by simply defining it as a
function of the full body weight by means of a simple formula.</p>
<p>But other dimensions are more subtle and difficult to establish as a
direct functional dependency of other parameters. Tendon lengths are
perhaps the most prominent example. If you are in doubt of the
importance of tendon lengths, just try to bend over and touch your toes
with your knees stretched. Some of us have hamstring tendons that are so
short that we can hardly reach beyond our knees, so tendon lengths
directly limit our ranges of motion. But they also influence the working
conditions of our muscles even when the muscle-tendon unit is not
stretched to its limit, so it is important that we define the muscle
tendon unit so that it fits the body model.</p>
<p>A muscle-tendon unit is attached to at least two segments at its origin
and insertion respectively. To make things worse, some muscles span
several joints, and most muscles wrap over bones and other tissues with
complex geometries on their way from origin to insertion. So, the basic
idea behind calibration of tendon lengths in AnyBody is the assumption
that each muscle-tendon unit has its optimal length at some particular
position of the joints it spans. We simply define one or several studies
that put the body model in these positions and adjust the lengths of the
tendons to give the attached muscles their optimal lengths in those
positions. When you subsequently run an analysis, the system uses the
calibrated tendon lengths regardless of how they are defined in the
AnyScript file. (This means that you have to run the calibration(s)
every time you have reloaded the model if they are to take effect).</p>
<p>AnyBody has several different types of muscle models. Some are very
simple and contain no strength-length relationship, while others do. It
goes almost without saying that the former type is not affected by
calibration. If you use one of the latter - more advanced - models,
however, calibration may be crucial. If the tendon is too long, the
muscle will end up working in an unnaturally contracted state where it
has very little strength. If the tendon is too short, the muscle will be
stretched, and its passive elasticity will affect the force balance in
the system. Since the passive elastic force in a muscle-tendon unit
typically grows very rapidly with stretching, a too short tendon can
cause very large antagonistic muscle actions.</p>
<p>Enough talk! Let’s define a muscle and calibrate it. We shall begin with
the simple arm model we developed in the “Getting Started: AnyScript
Programming” tutorial. If you have not already saved the model in a
file, get it here: <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/e519c5eec189aec55bfb8c224737cbe3/arm2d.any"><code class="xref download docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">arm2d.any</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>In that simple example, all the muscles were assumed to be of a simple
type with constant strength. We shall add another and much more detailed
muscle model:</p>

<p>As you can see from the comments, the muscle has many parameters you
have to set. The significance of each of these is explained in detail in
the muscle modeling tutorial. For this model to take effect, we must
assign it to the biceps long muscle. It is a little further down in the
file, where the red line must be changed:</p>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What we have done here is to give BicepsLong a new and more advanced
muscle model. In this lesson, we also switch to a different muscle
recruitment criteria MR_MinMaxStrict, which is better suited for
InverseDynamics of overloaded models:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">AnyBodyStudy</span> <span class="n">ArmStudy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s have a look at the consequences. Press Load button or F7 and
subsequently run the InverseDynamics study. Then, press Ctrl + 1 to navigate to the Chart  to
investigate the results.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart view BicepsLong.Ft" src="../_images/image134.png" /></p>
<p>This graph shows the muscle force or more precisely the force in the tendon. The
force in this more complex muscle model is composed of 3 elements: Fm, the
muscle force is the force from the contractile element of the muscle. Parallel
to Fm is Fp which is the passive elastic element in the muscle. Conected in
series of the muscle, is the tendon where Ft is the elastic tendon force. If you
pick the Fp property, you should get the following graph:</p>
<p><img alt="Chart view BicepsLong.Fp" src="../_images/image227.png" /></p>
<p>The parallel-elastic force Fp sets in when the muscle is stretched beyond
its optimal fiber length. In the movement of this example, the elbow
starts at 90 degrees flexion, and as the graph shows, this gives rise to
about 0.7 N of passive force at the beginning of the movement. This
indicates that the tendon we have specified is too short. If the
movement was extending the elbow instead of flexing it, the passive
force would rise. This means that the result of the simulation
depends a lot on having the correct length of the tendon. If it is too
short, too much of the load will be carried by passive muscle forces. In
this example where we have only one muscle with a complex model, it
would not be too difficult to adjust the tendon length manually until we
get it right, but in models with many muscles, this can be a very
tedious task, particularly since it has to be repeated every time the
dimensions of the model are changed. Instead, the answer is to let
AnyBody calibrate the tendon length automatically.</p>
<p>AnyBody’s advanced muscle model, the AnyMuscleModel3E, is basically a
phenomenological model based on the classical works of Hill. It presumes that
each muscle has an optimum contraction in which its fibers have their best
force-producing capability. To do a simple 1 parameter calibration we would need
to know the set of joint positions corresponding to this optimum fiber length
for each muscle, then those joint positions were the ones we would be
calibrating the muscle in.</p>
<p>Calibrating the muscle in a particular position requires a calibration
study. Its basic definition is straightforward:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you load the model you can study the structure of the new study in the Operations tab:</p>
<p><img alt="Operations Main.InverseDynamics" src="../_images/image327.png" /></p>
<p>You can see that it has multiple operations. The interesting ones are
the two latter: TendonLengthAdjustment and LigamentLengthAdjustment. As
the names indicate, they are for tendon and ligament calibration
respectively. Notice that the study only has one time step. The model
posture in that step should be the position in which you wish to
calibrate the tendon. If you run the TendonLengthAdjustment operation
you will notice that the model takes the initial posture of the flexion
movement it was doing in the InverseDynamics. This is because of the
line</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">AnyFolder</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">Model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ArmModel</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ArmModel contains movement drivers, and when they are included in
the study they cause the model to attain the same posture in the
calibration study as it does in the inverse dynamic analysis. To be able
to calibrate in another posture we must perform a small restructuring of
the model and perhaps recommend a organizing things a little differently
in general when making models.</p>
<p>We included the movement in the model when we developed it in the
“Getting Started with AnyScript” tutorial because we wanted things to be
simple. But think for a moment about how you would typically want to use
models. Let’s imagine you have developed a model of a leg. One day you
might want to simulate squat, another day perhaps gait, and yet another
day a football kick. You would want to use the same model but with
different sets of drivers. This speaks in favor of having drivers,
loads, and other problem-specific properties outside the folder
containing the body model.</p>
<p>Calibration is actually an example of using the same model with two
different movements, so we have to place the drivers outside the
ArmModel folder. In the editor, highlight the entire Drivers folder, cut
it out, and paste it in right below the end of the ArmModel folder like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// MyModel</span>

<span class="gr">    DriverPos = {-100*pi/180};</span>
<span class="gr">    DriverVel = {30*pi/180};</span>
<span class="gr">    Reaction.Type = {Off};</span>
<span class="gr">  }; // Shoulder driver</span>

<span class="gr">    DriverVel = {45*pi/180};</span>
<span class="gr">    Reaction.Type = {Off};</span>
<span class="gr">  }; // Elbow driver</span>
<span class="gr">}; // Driver folder</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that after moving the Drivers folder we have changed the
references to the joints. We also have to change the study a little bit.
This is because the study points at the ArmModel folder and that no
longer contains a movement, so the study would not know how to move the
model, unless we add this line:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// The study: Operations to be performed on the model</span>

<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we are ready to define a couple of static drivers specifically for
calibration of the muscles. We create a CalibrationDrivers folder right
below the Drivers folder:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">};</span> <span class="c1">// Driver folder</span>

<span class="gr">AnyFolder CalibrationDrivers = {</span>

<span class="gr">    DriverVel = {0.0};</span>

<span class="gr">    DriverVel = {0.0};</span>
<span class="gr">    Reaction.Type = {Off};</span>
<span class="gr">  };</span>
<span class="gr">};</span>


<span class="c1">// The study: Operations to be performed on the model</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These drivers are static because their velocities are zero. They specify
a posture with the upper arm vertical and the elbow at 30 degrees
flexion. Notice the expressions converting degrees to radians.</p>
<p>The final step is to modify the calibration study is to use the calibration
drivers:</p>
<div class="highlight-AnyScriptDoc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">// A new calibration study</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>What we have now is a study that uses the model together with two static drivers
for calibration of the muscles, and a study that uses the model with the
previous set of dynamic drivers. If you run the CalibrationStudy
TendonLengthAdjustment first, the system will adjust the tendon lengths and
remember the values for the until the model is reloaded. Now run the
InverseDynamics study and have a look at the chart. Notice that the Fp passive
muscle force now is zero because the BicepsLongModel slack length Lt0 was
elongated by the calibration.</p>
