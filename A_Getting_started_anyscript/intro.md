# Getting started: AnyScript Programming

AnyScript is the model definition language of the AnyBody Modeling
System (AMS). It has been specially designed for describing the workings
of the human body and its interactions with environmental objects such as
exoskeletons, sports equipment, workplaces, etc.

In this tutorial, you will create your first AnyScript model, a
simplified model of an arm.

Each lesson (after lesson 1) begins with a link to a file containing the
AnyScript code introduced up to that point. If you have a problem getting your
code to work, simply download the demo files and start from there.

*The AnyScript Reference Manual* provides comprehensive details on all the
classes, functions, etc. available in AnyScript. You can access The AnyScript
Reference Manual by opening an AnyBody window and selecting 'Help' -> 'AnyScript
Reference' from the top menu.
