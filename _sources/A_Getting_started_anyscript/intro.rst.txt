AnyScript is the model definition language of the AnyBody Modeling
System (AMS). It has been specially designed for describing the workings
of the human body along with environmental objects that it may work
along with, for example, exoskeletons, sports equipment, workplaces,
etc.

In this tutorial, you will create your first AnyScript model, a
simplified model of an arm.

Each lesson (after lesson 1) begins with a link to a file with the
AnyScript code. If you have a problem getting your to code work, simply
download the file and start from there.

This tutorial consists of the following lessons:
