# Lesson 4: Using Surfaces to Define the Knee Joint

The knee model developed in the previous lessons is obviously very
simple and does not resemble the geometry of a real anatomical knee very
well. However, AnyBody also contains facilities for development of more
realistic geometries of surfaces such as the femoral condyles, and we
shall explore those in this lesson. We start from the model developed in
the third lesson. If you did not manage to obtain a working model from
the third lesson, then please download a new one
{download}`here <Downloads/DemoSimpleKnee3.any>`.

In this example, we are modeling the knee joint using some simplified
2-D implants (see picture) for the femoral head and the tibial plateau.
To do this, we add some STL surfaces for theses implants to the model
and use them to calculate a contact force, which changes the joint
kinematics by making the implant surfaces slide along each other in the
simulated motion.

:::{warning}
Please note that if the surface has thin parts is a good idea to remove 
the backside of the surface so that it becomes open. This ensures 
that the forces will continue to grow as the surfaces are compressed into 
each other.

Due to the Force Dependent Kinematics (FDK), the joint axis for the knee
moves as a function of external forces and muscle forces. In this lesson
we want to have a closer look at this migration. Before inserting the implant,
we relocate the position of the insertion node of the quadriceps muscle on 
the tibia back to the initial position.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-1.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

We now start by adding an `AnyDrawRefFrame` to the KneeCenter node of the thigh
and the shank segments to show the migration. For the thigh segment we add the
following:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-2.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

And we do the same for the shank:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-2.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

Hiding the blue cylinder and running the model again shows that there is
a rather big distance between the knee center nodes of thigh and shank.

Now we start to add our new knee joint by adding the knee implant parts
to the model. We need the two STL files
{download}`simplefemoral.stl <Downloads/simplefemoral.stl>` and
{download}`simpletibial.stl <Downloads/simpletibial.stl>`. First, we define the
femoral condyles as an AnySurfSTL inside the KneeCenter and add an
`AnyDrawSurf` object inside to also be able to see the geometry:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-3.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

The geometry of the tibial plateau would be a little bit misplaced if we
would just add it the same way as the femoral condyles. To adjust it to the
right position, we add a new node `SurfSTLCenter` centered at the right
position and define the `AnySurfSTL` inside this node:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-3.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 2
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 2
```

When we now run the simulation and hide the blue cylinder in the knee
center, we can see that the surfaces penetrate each other quite a lot,
so just putting in the geometries into the model does not change
anything except that the locations of the two implants are now visible.

```{image} _static/lesson4/image2.jpg

```

Now, we want to make the surfaces slide along each other. Therefore, we
define a contact force that pushes the surfaces apart as soon as they
are in contact. We define an `AnyForceSurfaceContact` and place it just
below the definition of the Shank. For the definition an
`AnyForceSurfaceContact`, we have to specify the two contacting STL
surfaces (the first one is called master, the second is the slave
surface) and a pressure module. This pressure module is a constant
defining a linear law between penetration volume and force. In this
example we use a more or less arbitrary value for this module. Our
`AnyForceSurfaceContact` object looks like this:

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson4/snip.SimpleKnee.main-4.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

The `AnyForceSurfaceContact` creates a 3-D force vector located in the
center of pressure whenever the volumes defined by the STL files
penetrate each other. If the volumes are not penetrating, these forces
just become zero.

Running the simulation now shows that the tibial plateau slides along
the femoral condyle and the reference frames defined in the knee centers
stay close to each other with minmal penetration.

```{image} _static/lesson4/image3.jpg

:align: center
:width: 70%
```

You will experience that the simulation takes longer to run now. When running
simulations like this one, we can encounter that in many steps the system cannot
be solved with the requested error tolerance. The reason for this problem is
that small changes in the position can result in big changes in the contact
force. Possibilities to improve this behavior are to exchange the surface
geometries and use finer meshes or to use a softer contact by reducing the
`PressureModule`.

We are now done with this lesson. You can now play around with this
model by changing e.g. the pressure module to change the penetration of
the implants or the positions of the tibial part to change the motion.
If you couldnâ€™t make your model run up to this point, you can find the
complete model {download}`here <Downloads/DemoSimpleKnee4.any>`.

In {doc}`Lesson5 <lesson5>` we can see how this kind of joint can be
included into an existing model based on an AMMR body model.
