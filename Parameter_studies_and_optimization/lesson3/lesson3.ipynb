    "facilities for optimizing. Sometimes that is not enough, either because the\n",
    "objective functions depends on data that is not easily included in AnyBody, or\n",
    "because a different solver is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we use an external optimizer together with AnyBody. The example\n",
    "is based on the model from the {doc}`previous lesson <../lesson2>` but uses an\n",
    "optimizer from the [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) python library. The same\n",
    "could also have been achived with other optimization frameworks (like [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or languages like [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)).
