    "# Optimization Studies in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization study introduced in the preceding lesson used AnyBody's builtin\n",
    "facilities for optimizing. Sometimes that is not enough, either because the\n",
    "objective functions depends on data that is not easily included in AnyBody, or\n",
    "because a different solver is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we use an external optimizer together with AnyBody. The example\n",
    "is based on the model from the {doc}`previous lesson <../lesson2>` but uses an\n",
    "optimizer from the [Scipy](https://scipy.org/) python library. The same\n",
    "could also have been achived with other optimization frameworks (like [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or languages like [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)). The example is written and run in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), but the Python Scipt can also be run from other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin you need to install Python and some libraries. Using the `conda` package manager, makes this much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Download and install the conda-forge package manager](https://conda-forge.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need one additional Python library (AnyPyTools) which will make it\n",
    "easier to work with AnyBody from Python. [AnyPyTools](https://anybody-research-group.github.io/anypytools-docs/) can be easily\n",
    "installed from the command prompt. Open the Anaconda command prompt and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bat\n",
    "conda install anypytools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Python script\n",
    "\n",
    "First we show the full Python program used in this tutorial.\n",
    "Secondly, we will go through it and explain the different sections in the file. \n",
    "The first part below is the Python program, followed by the corresponding results from Jupyter Notebook.\n",
