# Lesson 3: Reviewing Analysis Results

(chart-view)=

## Introducing chart view

You can plot simulation results as graphs by using the Chart View, which can be opened by clicking the “Chart 1” tab in the Model View window. To
open Chart views manually go to View -> Charts.

**Not all variables in your model tree are necessarily simulation outputs. The chart view therefore presents a
filtered down version of the model tree, which only contains simulation outputs that can be plotted.**

One of the first nodes you encounter in this tree is the MaxMuscleActivity variable:

```{image} _static/lesson3/image1.png
:alt: Model tree
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

Selecting MaxMuscleActivity plots this variable vs time. The plot is a flat line
due to the static posture of the model.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image2.png
:alt: Chart MaxMuscleActivity 
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

If you want to see details of the actual values being plotted, click this
button <img src="_static/lesson3/image3.png" alt="Details_values" height="1.5em">. It adds a table with values below the chart:

```{image} _static/lesson3/image4.png
:alt: Chart actual values
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

**This chart shows you that when standing upright, the most active muscle in model is using about 12%
of that particular muscle's maximum strength.**

## Hip forces – Standing posture

Many biomechanical researchers want to see joint reactions forces, joint
moments (generated by muscles) and muscle activations. For your convenience, the
so-called SelectedOutput folder contains all those representative
values. You will find the folder in the tree here:

```{image} _static/lesson3/image5.png
:alt: Model tree
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

**👉 Now** navigate to the "Right.Leg.JointReactionForce" folder
by expanding the tree view like this:

```{image} _static/lesson3/image6.png
:alt: Model tree forces
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

If you select the ‘Hip_ProximoDistalForce’, you will see its value vs time in
the Chart View.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image7.png
:alt: Chart Hip force
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

From this chart, we can see that there is about 581N force at the
right hip joint in the proximodistal direction.

**It is possible to select and plot several outputs simultaneously
by using the asterisk character ({literal}`*`).** If you double-click
the "Value" property towards the top of your Chart View, it becomes editable. Let us
edit the last "Hip_ProximoDistalForce" term to "Hip\_\*". This
plots all variables in the "JointReactionForce" folder that begin with "Hip\_".

```{image} _static/lesson3/image8.png
:alt: Chart Hip_ forces
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

Now you will see the ‘Hip_MediolateralForce’, ‘Hip_ProximoDistalForce’
and ‘Hip_AnteroPosteriorForce’ in the same Chart View.

## Hip forces - Bent posture

The final step of this chapter is to change the posture of the human
model to see what happens to the hip joint reaction force.

To adjust the posture of the human model, open your Mannequin.any
file and change the PelvisThoraxExtension value from 0 to -60.

```{literalinclude} Snippets/lesson3/MyStandingHuman-1/Model/Mannequin.any
:language: AnyScriptDoc
:start-after: //# BEGIN SNIPPET 1
:end-before: //# END SNIPPET 1
```

Press the F7 button to reload the model and run the "RunApplication"
operation again. This will show the modified posture of the
human model in the Model View.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image9.png
:alt: Model view bent posture
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

Next, we will check the changes in the right hip joint reaction forces.

```{image} _static/lesson3/image10.png
:alt: Chart hip_forces bent posture
:class: bg-primary
:align: center
```

In the above Chart View, the largest hip joint reaction
force component is the "ProximoDistalForce" at about 1189N.
So compared to the normal standing posture model, the value has more than
doubled. The forces of the "Mediolateral" and "AnteroPosterior" directions have also
increased.

Congratulations! You have just completed your first biomechanical
analysis with the AnyBody Modeling System. Try changing the posture in the "Mannequin.any" file and investigate the new
results.
